I'm a PhD student from the [ETRO department][etro] at the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel][vub] in Belgium.
Our research group, Smartnets, is specialized in Wireless Sensors and Actuator Networks (WSAN) protocols and applications.
I focus on the performance of protocols used in Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks.

Our research group uses the [Contiki-NG][contiking] operating system to test communication protocols.
However, in 2015, the first official version of the [Rust][rust] <i class="fa-brands fa-rust"></i> programming language  was released.
Therefore, I implemented the [6LoWPAN][6lowpan] IPv6 stack in Rust and added it to the [smoltcp][smoltcp] crate.
