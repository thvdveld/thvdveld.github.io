My interests are embedded programming, especially in Rust, as well as electronics. I created this website to share my research, but also just everything else that I find interesting....",categories:[],tags:[],url:"/about",teaser:null},{title:"SHA3 and Keccak Variants Computation Speeds on Constrained Devices (2022)",excerpt:"In 2015, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced Keccak as the new primitive to be used in SHA 3, not replacing but complementing SHA 2. The Keccak primitive, based on a sponge construction, has flexible parameters that can be controlled by the user to fit the needs...",categories:[],tags:[],url:"/publications/00_sha3.html",teaser:null},{title:"Circuitree: A Datalog Reasoner in Zero-Knowledge (2022)",excerpt:"Driven by the increased consciousness in data ownership and privacy, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have become a popular tool to convince a third party of the truthfulness of a statement without disclosing any further information. As ZKPs are rather complex to design, frameworks that transform high-level languages into ZKPs have been...",categories:[],tags:[],url:"/publications/01_circuitree.html",teaser:null},{title:"Symmetric-Key-Based Authentication among the Nodes in a Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (2022)",excerpt:"To enable today\u2019s industrial automation, a significant number of sensors and actuators are required. In order to obtain trust and isolate faults in the data collected by this network, protection against authenticity fraud and nonrepudiation is essential. In this paper, we propose a very efficient symmetric-key-based security mechanism to establish...",categories:[],tags:[],url:"/publications/02_symmetric_key.html",teaser:null},{title:"Lightweight PUF based authentication scheme for fog architecture",excerpt:"Fog computing improves efficiency and reduces the amount of bandwidth to the cloud. In many use cases, the internet of things (IoT) devices do not know the fog nodes in advance. Moreover, as the fog nodes are often placed in open publicly available places, they can be easily captured. Therefore,...",categories:[],tags:[],url:"/publications/03_puf_based_authentication.html",teaser:null},{title:"CABE: A Cloud-Based Acoustic Beamforming Emulator for FPGA-Based Sound Source Localization",excerpt:"Microphone arrays are gaining in popularity thanks to the availability of low-cost microphones. Applications including sonar, binaural hearing aid devices, acoustic indoor localization techniques and speech recognition are proposed by several research groups and companies. In most of the available implementations, the microphones utilized are assumed to offer an ideal...",categories:[],tags:[],url:"/publications/04_cabe.html",teaser:null}];
