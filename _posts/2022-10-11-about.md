Welcome to my website!

I'm currently working on my PhD at the <i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns"></i> [Vrije Universiteit Brussel][vub] in Belgium
and started in 2019.
My interests are embedded programming, especially in Rust, as well as electronics.
I created this website to share my research, but also just everything else that I find interesting.

You can find more information about me at [Software](/software) and [Academia](/academia).
